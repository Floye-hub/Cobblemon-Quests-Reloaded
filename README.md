Cobblemon Quests Reloaded
Cobblemon Quests Reloaded is an unofficial, community-maintained fork of the original Cobblemon Quests mod.
This project updates and improves the mod for newer Minecraft, Cobblemon, and FTB Quests versions while keeping the original purpose intact: enabling quest creators to build Cobblemon-related quests directly inside FTB Quests.

The mod provides quest tasks for many Cobblemon actions, including:

Catching Pokémon

Defeating Pokémon

KO’ing wild Pokémon

Leveling up

Evolving Pokémon

And much more…

Just like the original mod, this fork:
➡️ does not add any quests by itself,
➡️ but provides the tools for creators and modpacks to design their own questlines.

Features
Updated compatibility with recent Minecraft, Cobblemon, and FTB Quests versions

This fork aims to keep the functionality up to date with modern mod versions.
